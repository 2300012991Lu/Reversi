# Reversi

Othello, or reversi, is a classic board game. It's easy to pick up, but it's hard to master for it is varied.

When Othello was first installed on personal computers, humans could easily beat computer players, so it was soon replaced by games such as Minesweeper.

In this project, I developed a simple Othello game, and provided a basic AI.
